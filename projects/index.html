				<h1>Side Projects</h1>
				<h2>SpaceBox (collaboration)</h2>
				<p>SpaceBox was created from a Rice Hackathon effort by Haihao Liu,
					Osmond Wen, Kevin Guo, and me! (All current Rice students.) It's an
				  n-body gravity simulator with scoring mechanics. Start by clicking
					anywhere and holding the mouse down to create a star. Then click,
					hold, and drag to throw a planet into orbit! The lower the
				  eccentricity of an orbit you throw, the higher your score for that
					planet! Click on the image below to play.</p>

				<h2>Loch Best Monster game</h2>
				<p>Loch Best Monster, created as a birthday present for someone special,
				  is inspired by the Japanese bullet-hell genre of video games. Use
				  the mouse to dodge fishing ships and bullets, while chasing blue dots
				  (fish). Special ships come out at multiples of 25 points ... if you
				  can get there! Click on the image below to play.</p>

				<h2>Aquarium Simulator</h2>
				<p>My first major project ever, Aquarium Simulator was an exploration into
				  main loops, deterministic time-steps, and object-oriented programming.
				  Click anywhere to drop donuts, and watch as the fish and sharks
				  interact with it and each other. Click on the image below to play.</p>

				<h2>Tetris Attack Clone</h2>
				<p>A collaborative project with my younger brother, Ryan, Tetris Attack
				  Clone is a reimagining of the classic Nintendo game series,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_League_(series)">Puzzle League</a>.
				  Tetris Attack is fiercely-beloved by a small community, and we hoped
				  to bring attention to this relatively unknown series. Click on the
				  image below to play.</p>

				<h2>The Beer Bike Game</h2>
				<p>In all honesty, the Beer Bike Game has no place being on a supposedly
					"professional" website, but it comes with a funny story. While taking
					a break during my freshman-year Rice Hackathon, I created the Beer
					Bike Game and filled it with crass humor to vent my frustrations.
					Because the Beer Bike Game predates my foray into GitHub hosting, the
					link was difficult to access until I linked to it here! Not
					recommeded for the faint of heart. To access the game from the source
					code, you will need to click on the play button on the top right
					corner. Click on the image below to play.</p>
